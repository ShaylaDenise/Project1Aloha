## Project1 Aloha
This is the first project I've created using html/css. It is designed to be the front page of Aloha fashion. 
This website displays all the required information and link in an effective and aesthetically pleaseing manner.
I have organized all divs with classes and/or ids so that they are easily targetted with css
I included a css reset and used all the required fonts and layout requirements as stated by the rubric
